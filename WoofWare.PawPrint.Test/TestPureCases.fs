    let assy = typeof<RunResult>.Assembly

    let unimplemented =
        [
            "GCMemoryInfoSpanProperties.cs" // `GC.GetGCMemoryInfo()` itself works (see GCGetMemoryInfo.cs), but its two span-valued properties don't past index 0. CoreLib builds them with `MemoryMarshal.CreateReadOnlySpan(ref _generationInfo0, 5)` / `(ref _pauseDuration0, 2)`: a byref to the *first* of a run of sibling fields, walked forward by sizeof(element), relying on `[StructLayout(Sequential)]` having laid them out contiguously. PawPrint models a heap object as named field cells, not a byte block, so `GenerationInfo[1]` becomes a byte-view read at offset 48 into `_generationInfo0`'s own 32-byte cell and fails in `IlMachineManagedByref.resolveCell` (IlMachineManagedByref.fs:1086) with "does not fit in single primitive cell". `Length` and index 0 both work. This is the general "sibling fields are not contiguous" gap rather than anything GC-specific; tracked as issue #729.
            "InterfaceSlotHiddenByDerivedMethod.cs" // PawPrint does not model interface slot ownership — which type's method implements a given interface-map entry's slot. `findClassImplementation` starts at the receiver and takes the first name/signature match, and `methodMatches` skips its non-virtual/`newslot` guard whenever the call target is an interface, so any same-signature method on the way down wins. The file covers both directions: a derived type that must *not* take an inherited slot (reproducible with no variance at all, and failing identically on `main`), and one that *must* take a slot it re-declares. Fixing it needs a real slot-to-implementation dispatch map, which changes ordinary non-variant interface dispatch too and so wants its own change; `VariantInterfaceSlotOwnership.cs` covers the cases the interface map alone can get right.
            "MarshalPtrToStructure.cs" // blocked at the unimplemented RuntimeTypeHandle_GetActivationInfo QCall. The non-generic `Marshal.PtrToStructure(IntPtr, Type)` allocates its result via `Activator.CreateInstance(Type, bool)` (Marshal.cs:572) before marshalling anything, which reaches `RuntimeType.CreateInstanceDefaultCtor` -> `RuntimeType.ActivatorCache` -> the QCall. PawPrint only intercepts the generic `Activator.CreateInstance<T>()` (IlMachineStateExecution.fs:875). Landing the QCall alone is not sufficient: `ActivatorCache` invokes the returned allocator/ctor addresses via `calli` (UnaryMetadataIlOp.fs:65, unimplemented), and CoreCLR's allocator is a JIT helper (reflectioninvocation.cpp:1565) with no managed MethodInfo to put in `NativeIntSource.FunctionPointer`. Split out of AdvancedStructLayout.cs, which now passes in full.
            "MarshalStructureToPtrDateTimeField.cs" // MarshalNative_TryGetStructMarshalStub doesn't yet synthesise an IL stub for has-layout-non-blittable structs; CoreCLR writes an 8-byte OADate (`MARSHAL_TYPE_DATE`) for a `DateTime` field, but PawPrint currently rejects the struct loudly rather than memmove-ing the managed `_dateData` bytes. Real implementation needs the OADate-conversion stub.
            "MarshalStructureToPtrDecimalField.cs" // MarshalNative_TryGetStructMarshalStub now rejects Decimal fields (CoreCLR routes them through `NFT_DECIMAL` stub synthesis because native `DECIMAL` is 8-byte aligned while managed `Decimal` is 4-byte aligned). Two follow-on gaps remain before this test can pass: (1) `Marshal.SizeOf<{int; decimal}>()` returns 20 instead of 24 because the marshal-size walk in `CliValueType.TryComputeMarshalSize` doesn't bump Decimal's field alignment to 8, and (2) the actual Decimal-marshal stub that writes a 16-byte native `DECIMAL` at the 8-byte-aligned offset.
            "MarshalStructureToPtrIntPtrField.cs" // Classifier+Memmove widening now lets `Marshal.StructureToPtr` reach the byte copy for `IntPtr`/`UIntPtr` fields, but the subsequent `Marshal.ReadInt32(ptr, ofs)` (Marshal.cs:332) does `(int)addr & 0x3` as an alignment check, hitting `Conv_I4` of a managed pointer to a native memory block. Needs alignment-aware `Conv_I4`/`Conv_U4` on managed pointers (or equivalent) to land.
            "ArrayGetInterfacesPointerElement.cs" // `RuntimeTypeHandle.GetInterfaces` handles a pointer-element array correctly (it is an ordinary SZ array handle, and `PopulateInterfaces` declines to add the implicit generic five because `arrayType.IsPointer`), but the test can't reach that far: materialising the `RuntimeType` for the *element* `int*` fails at `TODO: ldflda System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TypeDesc::_exposedClassObject through native pointer 0` (`UnaryMetadataFieldOps.fs:448`). Pre-existing and unrelated to interfaces — `typeof(int*).Name` alone hits it too, while `typeof(int*)` itself is fine. Needs a `RuntimeType` to be allocatable for a pointer TypeDesc.
            "ArrayClearPackedReferenceStruct.cs" // CoreCLR ignores `Pack = 1` for a value type containing GC pointers — references must stay pointer-aligned — so `struct { object O; byte B; }` is a 16-byte element there and `Array.Clear` derives a clear length that covers it exactly. `CliValueType.ComputeConcreteFields` does not apply that rule, so PawPrint computes a 9-byte element and the derived slot count truncates: for a single-element array the one store covers the reference and the trailing byte would simply survive, uncleared and unremarked. `writeArrayBytes` refuses such a zero write rather than answering wrongly, so this fails loudly. The fix belongs in struct layout — round a GC-containing value type up to pointer alignment — not in the clearing path, so it is left for its own change.
            "MdUtf8StringEqualsCaseInsensitiveUnicode.cs" // The `MdUtf8String_EqualsCaseInsensitive` QCall itself handles these cases (see the unit and property tests in `TestNativeMdUtf8String.fs`), but a non-ASCII member name can't reach it yet: `Encoding.UTF8.GetByteCount` on the requested name walks the string with a `clt.un` between two byrefs rooted at `ByrefRoot.StringCharAt` of the same string, and `ManagedPointerSource.tryByteAddressDeltaSign` only orders differing indices for `ByrefRoot.ArrayElement`, not `StringCharAt`. The ASCII half of the coverage lives in the sibling `MdUtf8StringEqualsCaseInsensitive.cs` and passes.
            "MakeGenericMethodConstraintSatisfied.cs" // The mirror of the passing MakeGenericMethodConstraintViolation.cs: arguments that *satisfy* a generic method's constraint must bind rather than throw, which is what stops an always-violating constraint check from passing the violation case. Binding does succeed, but reflection then continues into `RuntimeType.GetMethodBase` and reaches the unimplemented `RuntimeMethodHandle.IsDynamicMethod` InternalCall — an unrelated gap. Un-park when that lands.
            "MakeGenericMethodOpenArgument.cs" //`RuntimeMethodHandle_GetStubIfNeededSlow` (issue #743) handles `MakeGenericMethod` with closed type arguments, which is what every reachable path needs, but an argument that still contains generic parameters — `MakeGenericMethod(typeof(G<>))` or `MakeGenericMethod(someTypeParameter)` — cannot be represented. Both are legal: real .NET returns a MethodInfo with `ContainsGenericParameters = true`, inspectable but not invokable. PawPrint's `MethodHandle.MethodGenerics` is a `ConcreteTypeHandle list`, and `ConcreteTypeHandle` indexes `AllConcreteTypes`, whose entries carry only *closed* generic arguments, so the QCall fails with a precise TODO. Widening that representation reaches concretization and every other MethodHandle consumer, so it is its own change rather than part of the QCall.
            "TaskRunThrowSetsFaulted.cs" // Found while decomposing issue #713. As soon as a `Task.Run` delegate throws, Task's own internal exception-capture path does an `ldsflda` against a cross-assembly static field reached via a `MemberReference` token; `UnaryMetadataFieldOps.executeLdsflda` (UnaryMetadataFieldOps.fs:607) only handles `MetadataToken.FieldDefinition` and hits the catch-all `failwith $"Unexpectedly asked to load a non-field: {t}"` for anything else. Reproduces even from the minimal `t.IsFaulted` spin-check alone (no `.Wait()`/`.Exception` access needed), so this is inside Task's own fault-recording, not anything downstream.
            "TaskDelayWait.cs" // Found while decomposing issue #713. `Task.Delay(1).Wait()` reaches an unimplemented PInvoke, `SystemNative_SchedGetCpu` (`System.Private.CoreLib .Sys::SchedGetCpu() -> System.Int32`), via `NativeCall.failUnimplemented` (Native/NativeCall.fs:683). `NativeSystemNative.fs` has no case for it; the nearest sibling handler is `SystemNative_GetCpuUtilization` (NativeSystemNative.fs:195).
